Problem with Arrays:

1.Not friendly if we want to print the items in array (of user defined object)

See the ArrayDemo.java. We need to use Arrays.toString inside the syso statement.

2.Arrays don't resize themself:

See the ArraysDemo.java. we get java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 2

however we can add items by providing our own logic(this is an extra overhead for developers(specially the lazy one)).

3. Items in arrays can be duplicates.some scenarios it is expected but what if we want uniqueness . again this is overhead to developers
so there comes the concepts of Collection where these high level requirements are meet.



Difference between forEach and iterator?

we can't modify any items using forEach from a collection. See CollectionConcepts.java.

if we try removing/adding using remove/add method of collection , we get concurrent modification exception.See CollectionConcepts.java.


Lists are collections with iteration order
